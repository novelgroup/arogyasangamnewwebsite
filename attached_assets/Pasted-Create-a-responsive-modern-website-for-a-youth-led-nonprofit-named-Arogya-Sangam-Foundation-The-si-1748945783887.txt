Create a responsive, modern website for a youth-led nonprofit named Arogya Sangam Foundation. The site must adapt seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. Prioritize a minimalist design with dynamic user experiences — such as scroll animations, hover interactions, fade-in effects, and smooth transitions.

Design aesthetics:
	•	Minimalist layout with soft neutrals and earthy green accents
	•	Generous white space and clean typography (sans-serif)
	•	Sticky top navigation bar with logo
	•	Smooth scroll and responsive breakpoint adjustments

Homepage Requirements:
	•	Full-width hero section with tagline:
“Youth-led Health. Rooted in Tradition. Driven by Purpose.”
	•	Background animation or slow pan (optional but subtle)

Sections to Include (each should be dynamically laid out and fully responsive):
	1.	Our Vision & Mission

	•	Improve healthcare access and equity through advocacy, grassroots programs, and community resilience.

	4.	Community Impact – Testimonials or photo grid (auto-scaling with screen size)

	6.	Footer – Add social links, quick navigation, and a minimalist contact block
